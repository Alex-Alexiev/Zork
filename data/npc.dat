Herr Harker 3
You want a house when you get back? I know this guy,
and he needs a roommate. Kind of a weird guy though,
only comes out at night.

The four gods of this land worked forever to make myself and even you exist
I wish you good luck in your travels
Go on now, but stay safe my child.

Helpful Helper 7
Our kind is scattered throughout this island, we are devoted to assisting travelers like yourself
Always make sure to search a room for items and take them, nobody cares about theft
Make sure to equip items such as armor and weapons or else they are of no use
All the food on this island has magical properties that will help you gain your health back
Destroy the heart of the island to end the corruption
Shopkeepers exist only to deceive good folks like yourself, do not trust them
Make sure you are well equipped when heading into dangerous territory!

Hello there!
Oi, it's really nice what you’re doing.
Care for an ale?
Sorry, the corruption of this island prohibits anyone from giving items to travelers.
