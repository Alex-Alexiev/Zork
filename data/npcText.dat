You want a house when you get back? I know a guy
I know this guy, and he needs a roommate. Kind of a weird guy though, only comes out at night.
So if you’re ever interested let me know
Alrighty you can move along for now
Go on, you’re wasting your time
Good luck on your adventures
Listen you’re wasting my time get a move on
Listen you’re wasting my time get a move on
Listen you’re wasting my time get a move on

Hello there!
Oi, it's really nice what you’re doing.
Care for an ale?
Sorry, the corruption of this island prohibits anyone from giving items to travelers.
It will be a while before we can set sail on the seas
